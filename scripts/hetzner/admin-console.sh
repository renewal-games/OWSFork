# Start, stop or inspect the OWS admin console (owsmanagement) on the dev server.
#
# The console is behind the `admin` compose profile, so a plain `up -d` never starts it.
# It binds to 127.0.0.1 only: its sole credential is the X-CustomerGUID header, which is a
# tenant identifier the game client already sends on every public call. Reach it with an
# SSH tunnel, never by opening the port.
#
# Deliberately uses `--no-deps` for the build/up path so it cannot recreate the `database`
# container. See the CAUTION in docs/hosting/hetzner-dev.md: recreating Postgres severs
# every service's pool and any container holding a stale password fails with 28P01.
#
# Usage (from anywhere on the dev server):
#   ./scripts/hetzner/admin-console.sh up       # build (if needed) and start
#   ./scripts/hetzner/admin-console.sh rebuild  # force a rebuild from current source, then start
#   ./scripts/hetzner/admin-console.sh down     # stop and remove the container
#   ./scripts/hetzner/admin-console.sh status   # show state and health
#   ./scripts/hetzner/admin-console.sh logs     # follow logs
