.SYNOPSIS
    Open the OWS admin console running on the Hetzner dev server.

.DESCRIPTION
    The console (owsmanagement) is bound to 127.0.0.1 on the server and has no login of
    its own, so it is only ever reached over an SSH tunnel. This script:

      1. optionally pulls origin/main on the server and rebuilds the console image,
      2. starts the console (compose profile "admin", never touching the database),
      3. opens an SSH tunnel from this PC to it,
      4. opens the browser,
      5. on Ctrl+C, closes the tunnel and — unless -KeepRunning — stops the container.

    The console is stopped by default when you are done because the 4 GB dev host has
    little headroom left once the game services have taken their reservations.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Start-AdminConsole.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # First run after pushing console changes:
    .\Start-AdminConsole.ps1 -Update

.EXAMPLE
    # Leave it running on the server after the tunnel closes:
    .\Start-AdminConsole.ps1 -KeepRunning
